# Chuck Norris Facts

Ruby wrapper for https://api.chucknorris.io/#!

TODO
- Get rubocop in here
- Let's add some MiniTest tests in here - possibly write them before we write the methods??
- Move this and joke.rb into a lib folder
- Let's add a Rakefile to set up the Rake tasks (which would include at least the MiniTest tests)
- And a gemfile
# update this file with examples
